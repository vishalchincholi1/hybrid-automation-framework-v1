# This is a placeholder for the Excel file
# In a real project, you would have an actual Excel file here
# The Excel file would contain test data with columns like:
# TestCase | Username | Password | ExpectedResult
# TC001    | admin    | password123 | Success
# TC002    | user     | userpass    | Success  
# TC003    | invalid  | invalid     | Failure
# TC004    |          | password    | Failure
# TC005    | admin    |             | Failure

# To create the actual Excel file, you can:
# 1. Create a new Excel file named "LoginTestData.xlsx"
# 2. Add the above data in the first sheet named "LoginData"
# 3. Place it in the src/test/resources/testdata/ directory
